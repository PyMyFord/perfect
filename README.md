`prefect` is a Python library for interacting with your MyFordMobile-enabled vehicle. With `prefect`, you can:

- Lock your car
- Unlock your car
- Check your gas level, and, if you have one, your EV battery level
- Start your engine (e.g. to preheat your car in the Blustery Times Of Year), and stop your engine if you decide to stay home after all

`prefect` uses a reverse-engineered API, and may be unstable. DON'T PANIC.

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/PyMyFord/example-prefect-lambda) | Start your car with `ford-prefect` from an AWS Lambda |
| [ðŸš§ HomeAssistant](https://github.com/PyMyFord/PrefectHA) | Start/stop, lock/unlock your car with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) |

## Installation

```
pip3 install -U ford-prefect
```

## Usage

```python
from prefect import FordAPI

F = FordAPI()
F.authenticate(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
F.get_vehicles() # returns a list of dicts with metadata
my_car = F.get_vehicles()[0]

my_car.start_engine()

print(my_car.status()) # metadata dictionary
```

## Authentication

There are three ways to authenticate:

### Plaintext username and password

You can pass credentials directly into the `authenticate` call:
```python
F.authenticate(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
```

### Environment variables

You can set `PREFECT_USERNAME` and `PREFECT_PASSWORD` environment variables. If these are set, pass nothing to the `FordAPI#authenticate` call and they will be automatically detected.

### Config file

You can store credentials in a JSON config file, and pass the filename into the `authenticate` call:

`~/.config/myfordmobile.json`
```json
{
    "username": "",
    "password": ""
}
```

```python
F.authenticate("~/.config/myfordmobile.json")
```

Or, if you're using that filename (the default), you can omit it entirely:

```python
F.authenticate()
```

If no arguments are passed to this constructor, environment variables (method 2) will be checked first before the config file is checked. If both techniques fail, and no username and password were provided, the `authenticate()` call will fail.


## Hacking on this repo

- Submit pull requests for individual features
- Make sure things work locally before pushing

- When pushing new changes to the function signatures or new documentation, re-generate the `Reference.md` file under /docs. You can use [`docshund`](https://github.com/FitMango/docshund) to do this, *thusly*:

```shell
docshund prefect/__init__.py > docs/Reference.md
```

Install docshund with `pip3 install -U docshund`.
